# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices using housing data from Kaggle. The model leverages **Linear Regression** to estimate property values based on key features like location, size, number of rooms, and more.

---

## 📊 Objective

To accurately predict house prices using clean, preprocessed data and a well-tuned regression model.

## 📚 Data Source

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Real Estate Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Project Repository**: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/gogginz7/projects/tree/insight-of-sales/RealEstatePricePrediction)

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied

- Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
- Outlier Detection and Removal
- Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables
- GridSearchCV for Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Training using **Linear Regression**
